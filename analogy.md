Analogy – The Timebridge Mobile App
# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** ### **Product Name**: **Analogy** ### **Tagline**: “What was this like… back in the day?” ### **Purpose**:

Analogy is a delightful, humble, and thought-provoking mobile app that bridges modern comforts with their old-school counterparts. Users input any modern object, concept, or behavior (e.g., “food delivery”, “AI therapist”, “Instagram likes”), and based on their persona or emotional intent, the app returns a meaningful analogy from the past — not just functionally but also with an emotional or philosophical lens.
--- ## **1. Goals & Value Proposition**

    Help users see modern conveniences through a lens of humility and gratitude
    Offer personalized, reflective analogies tied to values like effort, patience, and ingenuity
    Be an app that teaches, entertains, and grounds users emotionally
    Encourage intergenerational empathy by showing how people used to live, love, and create before tech

--- ## **2. Target Audience**

    Modern users overwhelmed or curious about “simpler times”
    Teenagers or young adults gaining perspective
    Educators and parents teaching values through contrast
    Creators and product thinkers reflecting on how needs evolve
    Cultural observers, nostalgia lovers, old souls

--- ## **3. Features & Functionality** --- ### 🔍 A. **Input Experience**

    Users can type or say a modern-day term (e.g., “Whatsapp”, “Uber”, “Spotify”, “AI girlfriend”, “Photo filters”)

    Optional: Choose tone from a dropdown:
        Reflective 🧘
        Humble 🙏
        Funny 😂
        Nostalgic 🕰️
        Sarcastic 🙃
        Emotional ❤️

--- ### 🧠 B. **Analogy Generation (AI-Powered)**

    Based on input and tone, the app returns a single strong analogy in natural, impactful prose:

    Example:
    “Food delivery today is what handwritten recipe cards and a bicycle trip to the local grocer were for our grandparents — a dance between memory, effort, and love.”

    Option to “See Another Angle” or “Try Again with Different Tone”

--- ### 🎛️ C. **User Preferences / Persona Tag**

    Onboarding asks:
        Age group (for relatability)
        Interests (Tech, Culture, Philosophy, Simplicity, Humor)
        Mood (Seeking humility, inspiration, a laugh)

App tailors language, references, and tone based on this.
--- ### 💬 D. **Save, Share, Reflect**

    Favorite analogies (save to personal “Analogy Shelf”)

    Share as:
        Image Card (quote card style)
        Short reel / voiceover (TTS of analogy)
        Text to socials

    Option to “Remind me weekly with one analogy”

--- ### 🧓 E. **Analogy Archive**

        Love
        Work

--- ### 🧪 F. **Build Your Own**

    Users can enter both “Modern” and “Old” and write their own analogy
    Other users can upvote (community mode, optional)

--- ## **5. Design Philosophy**

    Warm, nostalgic, human
    Use aged textures, soft tones (sepia, navy, soft pastels)
    Hand-drawn icons, typewriter or serif fonts for analogies
    Avoid looking “techy” — instead feel like a memory book
    Include subtle haptics and scroll reveals for tactile feel
